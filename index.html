                    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
                    <p class="description">Tiles is a location-based exploration app that turns the world into a grid of hexagons. Each tile represents a real place that can be discovered, unlocked, and remembered through pins made with photos or/and notes. Also, it can be shared with other friends around the world and reply to that specific pin with your own media.</p>
                    <p class="description">I created Tiles from concept and UX research to the final iOS prototype built with Xcode, using Mapbox as a map provider and CloudKit as a backend.</p>
                    <p class="description">The project started as a personal idea and later grew into a startup concept during my participation in the <strong>Antler entrepreneurship program in Copenhagen</strong>, where I developed its early vision and product foundation.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Identifying the core problems</h2>
                    <p class="description">Most map apps are built for navigation, not discovery. They show you where to go, but not what's interesting around you or what stories others have experienced there. I wanted to create something that captures curiosity and connection through real places.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="section-card">
                    <h2 class="section-title">Solution</h2>
                    <p class="description">Tiles reimagines exploration as a creative experience. The map is divided into hexagonal tiles you can unlock by visiting them. Inside each tile, users can leave Pins contained with photos or notes that capture a moment. Your friends can also post Pins, making the map a shared memory space.</p>
                    <p class="description">It's not about likes or followers, but about personal discovery and shared experiences. When you open the map, you see your story layered over the real world.</p>

                    <p class="description">• Concept, research and product design<br>• UX and UI in Figma<br>• Visual identity and design system<br>• iOS implementation in Xcode using Swift, Mapbox, and CloudKit<br>• Testing and iteration based on user feedback</p>
                    <p class="description">Doing everything myself gave me full control over every detail, from how the app feels when you open it to how data syncs in the background.</p>

                <section class="section-card">
                    <h2 class="section-title">Design Approach</h2>
                    <p class="description">I built Tiles using Apple's new visual style from iOS 26. The interface uses minimal controls that doesn't interfere with the map. The experience is calm and immersive, focused on the feeling of exploring rather than consuming content.</p>
                    <p class="description">Each type of Pin is designed to blend naturally into the world view. The quick toolbar and context menus keep navigation fluid and always keeping the focus on the most important thing, the map, so you can capture a moment with one tap.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
                    <p class="description">Tiles is now a functional iOS prototype with:</p>
                    <p class="description">• A full Mapbox-based map engine<br>• CloudKit integration for users, pins, and friend pins<br>• Glass-effect quick toolbars and contextual actions<br>• A feed that connects map activity with shared moments</p>
                    <p class="description">It's currently being tested with early users on Testflight, and I'm continuing to refine both UX and performance.</p>

                    <p class="description">Tattoo and piercing studios in Spain face significant operational challenges, with more than 3,800 studios, over 80% of which still rely on paper-based systems. Among the most repetitive and legally mandatory tasks is the signing of informed consent forms, which outline health risks associated with tattoos and piercings. This process is time-consuming, averaging 15 minutes per client, and studios often only have forms available in Spanish, creating barriers for non-Spanish-speaking clients.</p>
                    <p class="description">Additionally, managing appointments, inventory, and invoicing manually results in inefficiencies that cost studios time and revenue. These operational bottlenecks hinder productivity and fail to meet the growing expectations of modern customers.</p>
