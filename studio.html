                <h2 class="section-title">Context</h2>
                <p class="description">Tattoo and piercing studios in Spain face significant operational challenges, with more than 3,800 studios, over 80% of which still rely on paper-based systems. Among the most repetitive and legally mandatory tasks is the signing of informed consent forms, which outline health risks associated with tattoos and piercings. This process is time-consuming, averaging 15 minutes per client, and studios often only have forms available in Spanish, creating barriers for non-Spanish-speaking clients.</p>
                <p class="description">Additionally, managing appointments, inventory, and invoicing manually results in inefficiencies that cost studios time and revenue. These operational bottlenecks hinder productivity and fail to meet the growing expectations of modern customers.</p>
